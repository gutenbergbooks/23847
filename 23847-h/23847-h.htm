<p class="pgbrk">THE little Poem now presented to the Public, was
intended for publication immediately after the appearance
of the &ldquo;Peacock at Home,&rdquo; but from various
causes, was laid aside till now. In the opinion of the
Publisher, however, it is so nearly allied in point of
merit to that celebrated Trifle, that he is induced, although
at this late period, to print it with a few appropriate
embellishments.</p>

<div>A dash in the whirlpool of Fashion to make.</div>
<div>A Concert and Ball, their attractions united,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>Awhile they fled on, over meadow, thro&#8217; grove,</div>

<div>The <span class="smcap">Peacock</span> for ease, and the <span class="smcap">Parrot</span> for talk;</div>
<div>Till, at last, poor <span class="smcap">Sir Argus</span> began to complain,</div>
<div>Of the sad inconvenience he felt from his train,</div>
<div>And propos&#8217;d, as the sky seem&#8217;d to threaten a shower,</div>

<div>However, our fair pensive warbler well knew,</div>
<div>Some sacrifice still to politeness was due;</div>
<div>She, therefore, soon hasten&#8217;d the coxcombs to meet;</div>

<div>A delicate supper before them was plac&#8217;d,</div>

<div>The favor was next of the <span class="smcap">Parrot</span> requested,</div>

<div>The sage Bird of Night had long chosen her station</div>

<div>How great, then, were now her dismay and surprise;</div>
<div>Thrice she call&#8217;d on Minerva, and thrice rubb&#8217;d her eyes;</div>
<div>But doubted not long; for the Visitors now</div>
<div>Came full in her presence, and made a low bow.</div>
<div>The Dame, tho&#8217; annoy&#8217;d, did not wish to be rude,</div>
<div>So she wisely receiv&#8217;d them as well as she could.</div>
<div>A frugal repast was prepar&#8217;d very soon,</div>
<div>Which together they shar&#8217;d, by the light of the Moon.</div>
<div>Some berries and seeds, the <span class="smcap">Owl</span> thought would suffice,</div>
<div>In addition to <em>her</em> stew of Small-birds and Mice;</div>
<div>And if no costly Viands awaited them here,</div>
<div>Keen hunger made up for the want of good cheer.</div>

<div>But the <span class="smcap">Peacock</span> had no inclination to wait,</div>

<div>So the Poem was read, and the <span class="smcap">Owl</span> vow&#8217;d she never</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>But, &ldquo;<em>who is the Author?</em>&rdquo; this still was the theme</div>

<div>O&#8217;er many a bank, with sweet violets spread,</div>
<div>Green field, blooming garden, and hyacinth-bed;</div>

<div>&ldquo;I wish that our travels, my friend, could end <em>here</em>:</div>
<div>Yet dread lest we many miles further should go,</div>
<div>And never, at last, our sweet Poetess know!&rdquo;</div>

 </span>But Fortune, capricious, who sports at her leisure,</div>
<div>With birds, as with men, when it suits her good pleasure,</div>
<div>Resolv&#8217;d, after teazing Sir Argus awhile,</div>
<div>To reward, in the end, all his toils with her smile.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>Aurora with splendor unusual arose,</div>
<div>When the <span class="smcap">Peacock</span> and <span class="smcap">Parrot</span> awoke from repose,</div>
<div>And how were their bosoms delighted and cheer&#8217;d,</div>
<div>When before them a perfect Elysium appear&#8217;d!</div>
<div>Reluctant they left it, again to explore,</div>
<div>Unconscious what happiness yet was in store:</div>
<div>But the country they travers&#8217;d was smiling and gay,</div>
<div>While the Sun, brightly shining, illumin&#8217;d their way;</div>
<div>And we all know how cheerful, how sweet is the scene,</div>
<div>When Nature unfolds her new livery of green.</div>
<div>The Birds carol&#8217;d round them, the Butterfly play&#8217;d,</div>
<div>And the soft vernal breeze kindly lent them its aid.</div>

 </span>Thus, gently reviving, Hope sooth&#8217;d them again,</div>
<div>And they shortly forgot both their sorrow and pain.</div>
<div>A path strew&#8217;d with flowers, they gaily pursued,</div>
<div>And, in fancy, their long-sought Incognita view&#8217;d;</div>
<div>Till, <em>all their cares over</em>, in <span class="smcap">Dorset</span><sup><a href="#fn.5"

<div>Now, what more remains of our <span class="smcap">Peacock</span> to say,</div>
<div>But that, homeward, triumphant, he wing&#8217;d back his way,</div>

<div>And proudly accepted their congratulation.</div>
